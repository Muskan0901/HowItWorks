    <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
    <div>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Neural Interface: The Dream Recorder employs a non-invasive neural interface that connects with the user's brain activity during sleep. This interface could utilize EEG (electroencephalography) or other neuroimaging techniques to detect and record brainwave patterns associated with dreaming.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sensot Array: Integrated sensors within the Dream Recorder monitor various physiological signals such as brain activity, eye movements (EOG - electrooculography), heart rate, and respiratory patterns. These sensors capture data throughout the sleep cycle, focusing particularly on REM (rapid eye movement) sleep when most vivid dreams occur.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data Capture and Storage: The recorded data is processed and stored securely within the device or transmitted to a cloud-based storage system. Advanced algorithms filter and analyse the data, identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of dream states.
        </li>
        <li>
            Al Interpretation: Utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, the Dream Recorder interprets the recorded dream data. It recognizes recurring themes, symbols, and emotional states within the dreams, providing users with insights into their subconscious thoughts and experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
            User Interface: The Dream Recorder features an intuitive user interface that allows users to review and manage their dream recordings. Users can navigate through recorded dreams, view detailed analyses, and customize settings according to their preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Privacy and Security: Privacy and data security are paramount. The Dream Recorder implements encryption protocols and robust authentication mechanisms to safeguard sensitive user data, ensuring confidentiality and peace of mind.
        </li>
        <li>
            Feedback and Improvement: User feedback and ongoing research contribute to the continual improvement of the Dream Recorder's algorithms and features. This iterative process enhances the accuracy of dream interpretation and enriches the overall user experience.
